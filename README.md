Project Title: Earnings Call Language & Market Reaction


An Exploratory Analysis of Management Tone and Post-Announcement Stock Returns

Executive Summary:
This project investigates how the tone and communication style of corporate earnings calls influence short-term market reactions. Using transcripts collected via the DefeatBeta API and market data from Yahoo Finance, the analysis integrates natural language processing (VADER sentiment analysis, word frequency, and sentence complexity) with quantitative stock performance metrics, including 1-day, 3-day, and 5-day abnormal returns.The dataset includes transcripts from the top two publicly listed companies across major sectors such as Technology, Communication Services, and Healthcare. Sentiment scores were computed using VADER, then matched with post-earnings stock performance to assess whether optimistic or pessimistic management language correlates with market reactions and whether these effects differ across industries. By combining textual sentiment analysis with financial performance data, this study uncovers behavioral patterns in how investors respond to corporate communication.

Three core questions guided the study:
1. Does more positive management tone lead to stronger short‑term returns?
2. Are some sectors more sentiment‑sensitive than others?
3. Which linguistic features (polarity, emotional intensity, sentence complexity) matter most?

The findings reveal that while most companies maintain an optimistic and consistent tone, sentiment alone has limited predictive power for short-term returns. Negative language modestly dampens investor response, whereas overly complex communication reduces clarity and weakens market impact. Simpler, balanced, and credible communication styles correlate with stronger, though not necessarily higher, investor reactions. Sectoral analysis shows that consumer-driven and tech sectors react more to tone shifts, while financial firms prioritize fundamentals over sentiment. Overall, the project demonstrates that effective investor communication is rooted in clarity and precision rather than emotional tone, suggesting that markets reward substance and transparency over rhetorical optimism.
